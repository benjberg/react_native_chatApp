# react-native-chatapp

to run the project fork and clone the repository and in the terminal run npm I to install all needed dependencies.

In this project I explored the basics of react native while building a basic chat room. This project was a bit new for me as I have never used react native, firebase or GiftedChat.

React native proved to be fairly easy to grasp as I have extensive react knowledge already. I love how you can program for both Android and IOS while still using JS as the language. It saves learning object c or swift and can still produce great functioning and looking fully mobile apps. I really look forward to seeing what else I can do in RN, I have a few future projects that I am really excited about now that I have a grasp of what RN can really do.

Firebase was a cool experience because i had never dealt with a live server storing and serving info in real time. I have previously worked with databases that store info but you would call it only when you needed it whereas the chat app connects all users to a single room and serves all messages through the firebase db. Overall I had a good time digging into FB and messing around in the developers console.

GiftedChat is a dependency that makes chat really easy, set up was breeze and implementation couldn't have been smoother. I would say out of the whole project working with GiftedChat was the easiest part. They make it fairly easy to be just about a plug and play operation with very few things needed for it's initial set up.
